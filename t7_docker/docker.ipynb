    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone packages that include everything needed to run a software application - code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. This makes applications portable and ensures they run consistently across different environments.\n",

    "## Docker Commands\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Build all services\n",
    "docker-compose build\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pull all images\n",
    "docker-compose pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Service Management\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Start services\n",
    "docker-compose start\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stop services\n",
    "docker-compose stop\n",
    "\n",
    "# Restart services\n",
    "docker-compose restart\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run command in service\n",
    "docker-compose exec <service> bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Validate and view composed configuration\n",
    "docker-compose config\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Docker Compose Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a sample Docker Compose configuration for a Python web application:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# docker-compose.yml\n",
    "version: '3'\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  web:\n",

    "    ports:\n",
    "      - \"5000:5000\"\n",
    "    volumes:\n",
    "      - .:/app\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      - FLASK_ENV=development\n",
    "  db:\n",
    "    image: postgres:13\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      - POSTGRES_DB=myapp\n",
    "      - POSTGRES_USER=user\n",
    "      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running a Web Application\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# View logs\n",
    "docker-compose logs -f web\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stop the application\n",
    "docker-compose down\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container Management\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Restart a specific service\n",
    "docker-compose restart web\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scale a service\n",
    "docker-compose up -d --scale web=3\n",
    "\n",
    "# View container status\n",
    "docker-compose ps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Start containers in development mode\n",
    "docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run tests in container\n",
    "docker-compose exec web python -m pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "# View application logs\n",
    "docker-compose logs -f\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Always use version control for your Docker and Docker Compose files\n",
    "2. Keep images small by using multi-stage builds\n",
    "3. Use environment variables for configuration\n",
    "4. Tag your images appropriately\n",
    "5. Use volumes for persistent data\n",
    "6. Clean up unused containers and images regularly\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "Common commands for troubleshooting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check container logs\n",
    "docker-compose logs <service>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inspect container\n",
    "docker inspect <container>\n",
    "\n",
    "# View resource usage\n",
    "docker stats\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check network\n",
    "docker network ls\n",
