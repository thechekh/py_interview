    "In Python, both `is` and `==` are used for comparison, but they serve different purposes. Here's a detailed explanation of each:\n",

    "## `==` (Equality Operator)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Compares the **values** of two objects to check if they are **equal**.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Checks if the contents or data of two objects are the same.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print(a == b)  # Output: True (since the lists have the same content)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## `is` (Identity Operator)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Compares the **identity** of two objects, checking if they refer to the same object in memory.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Checks if two objects are the exact same instance (i.e., have the same memory address).\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  b = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "  # Comparing with the same object reference\n",
    "  c = a\n",
