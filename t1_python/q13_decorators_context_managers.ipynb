    "# Decorators and Context Managers in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Decorators in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **decorator** is a function that modifies the behavior of another function or method. It is a way to wrap another function, allowing you to extend or alter its behavior without modifying its source code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Decorators Work:\n",
    "1. **Definition**: A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that typically extends or modifies the original function’s behavior.\n",
    "2. **Syntax**: Decorators are applied using the `@decorator_name` syntax above a function definition.\n",
    "3. **Use Cases**: They are commonly used for logging, authorization, memoization, timing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a Decorator:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A simple decorator\n",
    "def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper():\n",
    "        print(\"Before the function runs\")\n",
    "        func()\n",
    "        print(\"After the function runs\")\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applying the decorator\n",
    "@my_decorator\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "greet()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before the function runs\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "After the function runs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `my_decorator` takes the `greet` function, wraps it in the `wrapper` function, and adds behavior before and after the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Context Managers in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **context manager** is used to manage resources such as files, database connections, or locks. It ensures that a certain setup is done before the block of code runs, and a cleanup action is performed afterward. Context managers are most commonly used with the `with` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Context Managers Work:\n",
    "1. **Definition**: A context manager is any object that implements the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. The `__enter__` method is executed when the `with` block starts, and the `__exit__` method is executed when the block ends, regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "2. **Use Cases**: Commonly used for resource management tasks like closing files or releasing locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a Context Manager:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyContextManager:\n",
    "    def __enter__(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Entering the context\")\n",
    "        return self\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n",
    "        print(\"Exiting the context\")\n",
    "        if exc_type:\n",
    "            print(f\"An exception occurred: {exc_value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the context manager with 'with'\n",
    "with MyContextManager():\n",
    "    print(\"Inside the context\")\n",
    "    # Uncomment to test exception handling\n",
    "    # raise ValueError(\"An error occurred\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Entering the context\n",
    "Inside the context\n",
    "Exiting the context\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you uncomment the `raise` line inside the `with` block, the `__exit__` method will still be called, and the exception will be handled inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences between Decorators and Context Managers:\n",
    "- **Purpose**:\n",
    "  - Decorators modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods.\n",
    "  - Context managers manage resources and ensure proper setup and cleanup of resources.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "  - Decorators use `@decorator_name` above a function.\n",
    "  - Context managers use the `with` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case**:\n",
    "  - Decorators are typically used for modifying function behavior (e.g., logging, caching).\n",
    "  - Context managers are used for managing resources (e.g., file handling, database connections).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both decorators and context managers are powerful tools for managing behavior in Python, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.\n",
