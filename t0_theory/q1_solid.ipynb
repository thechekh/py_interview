    "# SOLID Principles in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOLID principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers create flexible, maintainable, and scalable software. Here's an overview of the SOLID principles in the context of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "- **Definition**: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. In other words, it should have a single responsibility.\n",
    "- **In Python**: This means designing classes or functions that focus on a single task or purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ReportGenerator:\n",
    "    def generate_report(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Generating report...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class EmailSender:\n",
    "    def send_email(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Sending email...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Each class has a single responsibility\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)\n",
    "- **Definition**: Software entities (classes, functions, modules) should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "- **In Python**: Use inheritance or composition to extend functionality without changing existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Notification:\n",
    "    def send(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class EmailNotification(Notification):\n",
    "    def send(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Sending email notification...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class SMSNotification(Notification):\n",
    "    def send(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Sending SMS notification...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# New types of notifications can be added without modifying existing code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n",
    "- **Definition**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.\n",
    "- **In Python**: Ensure that subclasses override methods without changing their expected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Flying...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Sparrow(Bird):\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Sparrow flying...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subclass behavior is consistent with the base class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n",
    "- **Definition**: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Instead, break down large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.\n",
    "- **In Python**: This can be achieved through multiple small, targeted methods or abstract base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Printer:\n",
    "    def print_document(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Scanner:\n",
    "    def scan_document(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class MultiFunctionPrinter(Printer, Scanner):\n",
    "    def print_document(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Printing document...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def scan_document(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Scanning document...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Separate interfaces for print and scan functionality\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n",
    "- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "- **In Python**: Use dependency injection or abstractions to decouple high-level and low-level components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class NotificationSender:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, notifier):\n",
    "        self.notifier = notifier\n",
    "\n",
    "    def send(self):\n",
    "        self.notifier.send()\n",
    "\n",
    "class EmailNotifier:\n",
    "    def send(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Sending email...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class SMSNotifier:\n",
    "    def send(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Sending SMS...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dependency Injection\n",
    "notifier = EmailNotifier()\n",
    "sender = NotificationSender(notifier)\n",
    "sender.send()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the SOLID principles in Python, you can write clean, modular, and scalable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
